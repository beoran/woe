# Goals of the the Workers Of Eruta FLOSS project.

It is impossible to describe all the goals of this project here,  
but said in short, for this project the main goals are:  

1. Implement a MUD base in go language, which is ideal for server applications and easer than C to modify.
2. Implement a MUD base with a license that unlike DIKU and it's descendents, allows it be used for pay-for-play MUDS.  
3. Implement the game of Workers of Eruta, wich is related to the Eruta game and world. 
4. WOE is a game by adults for adults, with some tastefully done adult contents. Less gore and teenage jokes than DIKU, more love.
5. Make a WOE game that is accessibe and fun for everyone, keeing in min especially the blind and those with visual problems.
6. Have fun while implementing WOE.
7. Keep the code reasonably clean, but don't care about pedantry such as golint...
