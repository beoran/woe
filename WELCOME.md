# Welcome to the Workers Of Eruta FLOSS project.

## Welcome

Everybody involved in this project would like welcome you and thank you for your 
interest in it. This project is brought to you with the hope that it will be 
useful to you, but without any warranty whatsoever. Please read the LICENSE 
for more details about this.

If you, in turn, like this project, and would like to help out, then 
we would like to welcome you to this project as a contributor. There are several 
ways in which you can contribute. Contributions can consist of source code, 
patches, but also bug reports, documentation, suggestions, artwork, or 
other relevant material. 

Everyone involved in this project would like you know that no matter who you are, 
no matter where you are from, no matter what your opinions or ideas are, 
we welcome your contributions to this project as long as they are in line with 
the project's goals.

It is impossible to describe all the goals of this project here,  
but said in short, for this project the main goals are:  

1. Implement a MUD base in go language, which is ideal for server applications and easer than C to modify.
2. Implement a MUD base with a license that unlike DIKU and it's descendents, allows it be used for pay-for-play MUDS.  
3. Implement the game of Workers of Eruta, wich is related to the Eruta game and world. 
4. WOE is a game by adults for adults, with some tastefully done adult contents. Less gore and teenage jokes than DIKU, more love.
5. Make a game that is accessibe to the blind and other people with visual problems.
6. Have fun while implementing WOE.
7. Keep the code reasonably clean, but don't care about pedantry such as golint...


## How to participate in this project

Everyone involved in this project would like to welcome you to the virtual 
spaces associated to this project. To make sure this project remains 
a project that welcomes contributors, we would like to ask of you
to follow the following rules in the project's virtual spaces when contributing:

1. Stay on topic. Refrain from posting SPAM, trolling, irrelevant discussions, ...
2. Obey the law. Refrain from death threats, harassment, theft, ... 
3. Behave like an adult. Refrain from personal attacks, dog piling, bullying...

Any participation that is not in line with these rules may be removed or locked
on a best effort basis by the maintainer(s). If you maliciously or repeatedly 
keep on disregarding these rules when participating, you may be temporarily 
or permanently banned from contributing to the project. This decision is made 
on a best effort basis by the maintainer(s). 

Naturally, these rules only apply within the context of the project. 
Your behavior outside of the project's virtual spaces will always be ignored. 
It cannot be used as a pretext to block your contributions or ban you from 
contributing. Like this we want to be welcoming to you even if you have 
unpopular opinions or made some mistakes in the past.

## What to do in case of problems

If you feel that you are being treated unfairly, that your contribution is not 
being evaluated fairly, or if someone does not follow the rules mentioned above, 
contact the maintainer(s) of this project by posting an issue about it on the 
github issue tracker (sorry, too much spam in my e-mail). We will do our best 
to remedy the situation. Please keep in mind that many FLOSS projects are run 
by volunteers, so we do not always have the resources to answer you immediately.

## How to contribute 

When you make a contribution the maintainer(s) of this project or someone 
appointed by them will perform a review. We would like to let you know that we 
will do our best to review your contributions fairly, and only take into 
consideration relevant factors, such as compatibility with the goals of the 
project, the absence of technical errors, practical advantages, .... 

The review process may be quite intense and severely critical, but the goal of 
the review is to improve your contribution so it can be integrated into the 
project without problems. We will do our best to focus our criticism on the 
contribution itself.

## How to become a maintainer

When it comes to the goals of this project, your suggestions are most welcome.
But it is important to know that goals of this project are decided by this 
project's maintainer(s). By virtue of the time and effort they put in this 
project, they have earned the privilege of defining the project's goals. 

If you are interested in becoming a maintainer, we ask to please contact 
the current maintainer(s) to ask them how to achieve this. If so inclined, you 
may also fork this project and become the maintainer of that fork 
to develop it according to your own goals.
